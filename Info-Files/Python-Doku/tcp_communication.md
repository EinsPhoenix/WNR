# TCP Client for Rust Server üöÄ

This document describes a Python script (`tcp_communication_example.py`) designed to interact with a Rust TCP server. It covers the script's features, how to use it, and the underlying communication protocol for sending requests to the server.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **TCP Connection Management:** Establishes and manages a TCP socket connection to the specified server host and port. üîå
*   **Password Authentication:** Handles the initial password authentication required by the server. üîë
*   **JSON Communication:** Sends data formatted as JSON strings and receives/parses JSON responses from the server. üìÑ
*   **Structured Request Types:** Supports sending different types of requests identified by a `type` field in the JSON payload (`message`, `command`, `data`). ‚úâÔ∏è ‚öôÔ∏è üìä
*   **Initial Data Loading:** Can automatically load and send JSON data from a `test.json` file upon successful connection and authentication. üìÇ
*   **Interactive Mode:** Provides a command-line menu for interactively sending different types of messages or custom JSON payloads to the server. ‚å®Ô∏è
*   **Response Handling:** Receives responses, parses them, and prints formatted output indicating success or error status. ‚úÖ ‚ùå
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Closes the TCP connection cleanly when exiting. üëã

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
    *   The Rust TCP server (which this client connects to) must be running and accessible on the network (default: `localhost:12345`).
    *   (Optional) A file named `test.json` should exist in the same directory as the script if you want to send initial data automatically. This file should contain a valid JSON object.

2.  **Running the Script:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory containing `tcp_communication_example.py`.
    *   Run the script using the Python interpreter:
        ```bash
        python tcp_communication_example.py
        ```

3.  **Authentication:**
    *   The script will attempt to connect to the server.
    *   If successful, the server will likely send a password prompt (e.g., "Password:").
    *   The script automatically sends the hardcoded password (`1234` in the example - **remember to change this in a real application!**).
    *   The server will respond with an authentication status message.

4.  **Initial Data Send (Optional):**
    *   If authentication succeeds and `test.json` is found and valid, the script will send its contents to the server.

5.  **Interactive Menu:**
    *   After the initial steps, you'll see a menu:
        ```
        --- Options ---
        1. Send message (type: 'message')
        2. Send command (type: 'command')
        3. Send custom JSON
        4. Exit
        Choose an option (1-4):
        ```
    *   Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform:
        *   **1:** Prompts you to enter message content. Sends a JSON with `{"type": "message", "content": "your_message"}`.
        *   **2:** Prompts you to enter a command string. Sends a JSON with `{"type": "command", "command": "your_command"}`.
        *   **3:** Prompts you to enter a complete JSON string. Useful for sending `data` types or other custom structures.
        *   **4:** Closes the connection and exits the script.

6.  **Server Responses:**
    *   After sending any data, the script waits for a response from the server.
    *   Responses are expected to be JSON objects with `status` (`success` or `error`) and `message` fields. The script prints these responses to the console, color-coded for clarity. üíö‚ù§Ô∏è

## üì° Server Communication Protocol (General)

This section describes how any client (not just the Python example) should communicate with the Rust server.

1.  **Transport:** Communication occurs over **TCP/IP**. The client initiates a connection to the server's IP address and port.
2.  **Authentication:**
    *   Upon connection, the server typically sends a password prompt (e.g., `Password:`). This prompt might not be terminated by a newline.
    *   The client must send the correct password as a plain UTF-8 string. **Crucially, the client should NOT add a newline character (`\n`) after sending the password.**
    *   The server validates the password and sends back a confirmation message (e.g., `Access granted\n` or `Access denied\n`), terminated by a **newline character (`\n`)**.
3.  **Data Format:** All subsequent communication (after successful authentication) uses **JSON** objects.
4.  **Message Framing:**
    *   The client sends a complete JSON object as a UTF-8 encoded string.
    *   **Important:** The client **does not** add a newline (`\n`) after sending its JSON request.
    *   The server processes the JSON request.
    *   The server sends back a JSON response string.
    *   **Important:** The server **terminates** its JSON response string with a single **newline character (`\n`)**. Clients must read data from the socket until this newline character is received to ensure they have the complete JSON response.
5.  **Request Structure:** Client requests should be JSON objects containing at least a `type` field to indicate the nature of the request. Common types observed in the Rust handler (`ip_payload_handler.rs`) are:
    *   **`message`**: For sending simple string messages.
        ```json
        {
          "type": "message",
          "content": "Your string message here"
        }
        ```
    *   **`command`**: For instructing the server to perform specific actions.
        ```json
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "name_of_the_command"
        }
        ```
        *(Example commands might be `init`, `reset`, `status`, etc., depending on the server's `command_handler::router` implementation)*
    *   **`data`**: For sending structured data, often for database operations. The exact structure of the nested `data` object depends on what the server's `handle_data` function (and subsequently `create_new_relation`) expects.
        ```json
        {
          "type": "data",
            "data": [
                {
                    "uuid": "test-uuid-1",
                    "color": "blue",
                    "sensor_data": {
                    "temperature": 22.1,
                    "humidity": 60
                    },
                    "timestamp": "2025-03-10 14:30:00",
                    "energy_consume": 0.3,
                    "energy_cost": 0.007
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

6.  **Response Structure:** The server typically replies with a JSON object containing:
    *   `status`: A string, either `"success"` or `"error"`.
    *   `message`: A string providing details about the outcome or the error encountered.
    ```json
    // Example Success Response
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Command 'init' executed successfully"
    }

    // Example Error Response
    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "No 'command' field found in JSON"
    }
    ```
