# WNR 🚀

## Overview 📝

This is a school project focused on demonstrating several key concepts. The project explores communication between system components like robots, PCs, and Raspberry Pis, utilizing protocols such as OPC/UA and TCP/IP sockets, including an implementation of the Dobot Communication Protocol. It features a Pick-and-Place system incorporating image processing for color recognition and robot control, with optional robot position correction. Furthermore, the project delves into measurement data acquisition using a database concept, covering database modeling (graph-based), load balancing under high database load (sharding), and simulation of measurement values to introduce artificial correlations (e.g., measurement errors at elevated temperatures). Finally, it addresses measurement data evaluation using MQTT, displaying data via a custom web application, and visualizing nodes with Three.js.
